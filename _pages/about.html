<p>I'm the Director of Reseach at <a href="https://sunbird.ai">Sunbird AI</a> in Uganda.
  Previously I was a Staff Research Software Engineer at Google Research, and tech lead for Africa projects at <a href="https://www.unglobalpulse.org/">UN Global Pulse</a>.</p>

 <p>Some projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="sunflower.sunbird.ai">Sunflower</a> is a collection of LLMs that support 31 Ugandan languages, optimised for machine translation.</li>
  <li>I started the <a href="https://sites.research.google/gr/open-buildings/">Open Buildings</a> project in Google Brain, using computer vision and satellite imagery to map (nearly) all the buildings in Africa, Latin America and South/Southeast Asia.</li>
  <li>At the UN I worked on language technology for <a href="https://jquinn.air.ug/files/PLK_2017_Radio.pdf">early warning from community radio stations</a>.</li>
