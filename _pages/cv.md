I've worked in Uganda since 2007, first for Makerere University as faculty in the Department of Computer Science, then for United Nations Global Pulse as technical lead of Pulse Lab Kampala, and now as a director of Sunbird AI. From 2018 I joined Google Research in Ghana. I've also spent time working at Tokyo Institute of Technology, Google Switzerland, Medical Emergency Relief International, and the Neonatal Unit at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. I'm originally from Inverness in the North of Scotland.
