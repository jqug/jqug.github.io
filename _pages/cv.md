I've worked in Uganda since 2007, first for Makerere University as faculty in the Department of Computer Science, then for United Nations Global Pulse as technical lead of Pulse Lab Kampala, and now Sunbird AI. In 2018 I concurrently joined the research team at Google Ghana. I've also spent time working at Tokyo Institute of Technology, Google Switzerland, Medical Emergency Relief International, and the Neonatal Unit at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. I received a BA in computer science from the University of Cambridge (2000), and my PhD in machine learning from the University of Edinburgh (2007). I'm originally from Inverness in the North of Scotland.
